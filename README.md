## Tools

Tool's description

### Pcap2Json

A tool to parse pcap files in order to find suspicious actions. The parsed data
is dumped on JSON format, as shown below:

```json
"HTTP": [{
		"Host": "bailXXXX.com",
		"Protocol": "HTTP",
		"IPdst": "209.99.Y.Z",
		"Path": "/Faculdade/Walts.zip",
		"PortDST": 80,
		"IPsrc": "192.168.1.1",
		"PortSRC": 49169,
		"Method": "GET"
	  }],
"DNS": [{"entry": [ {
		"Protocol": "DNS", 
		"IPdst": "192.168.1.1", 
		"PortDST": 53, 
		"IPsrc": "192.168.1.1", 
		"Type": "QUERY", 
		"PortSRC": 55604, 
		"Name": "time.windows.com."
	  }]},], 

```

### Honeypot2Run

A tool for scheduling samples for analysis procedures as soon as they are
trapped by a honeypot. The tool is Inotify based and is intended to be running
on background. The tool can span many analysis procedures at time, as shown
below:

```[INOTIFY] IN_CLOSE_WRITE called. PATH: /tmp/malware NAME: malware1 PATHNAME:
/tmp/malware/malware1
[INOTIFY] IN_CLOSE_WRITE called. PATH: /tmp/malware NAME: malware2 PATHNAME:
/tmp/malware/malware2
[Thread 1]: malware1 popped for analysis 
[INOTIFY] IN_CLOSE_WRITE called. PATH: /tmp/malware NAME: malware3 PATHNAME:
/tmp/malware/malware3
[Thread 2]: malware2 popped for analysis 
[INOTIFY] IN_CLOSE_WRITE called. PATH: /tmp/malware NAME: malwareN PATHNAME:
/tmp/malware/malwareN
[Thread 3]: malware3 popped for analysis
```
